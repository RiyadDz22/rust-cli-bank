# 🦀 Rust CLI Bank

A simple, interactive **Rust CLI banking application** where users can:

- 🆕 Create an account  
- 💰 Deposit money (paying off debts first if any)  
- 💸 Withdraw money (if sufficient balance)  
- 🏦 Take out a loan (with a 1000 limit)  
- 📊 View their balance and debt status  

This project demonstrates Rust fundamentals like ownership, structs, traits, pattern matching, and `HashMap` usage.

---

## 📦 Features

- Account creation and storage in a `HashMap`
- Loan and debt logic with repayment tracking
- Input parsing and error handling
- Simple terminal interface (cross-platform)
- Clean, beginner-friendly code with comments

---
